## Experimentation with c#

Getting back into c#.net after about 7 years. 
Snacketeria is kind of my HelloWorld I do whenever I'm learning a language. 
It's a simple consession stand simulator. This one features natural language ordering and output of your order.
Try ordering "A large popcorn please."
